## Image Guidelines:

- **Format**: PNG preferred for transparency support
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display
- **Style**: Modern, professional look
- **Colors**: Should work well with the dark theme
- **File Size**: Optimize for web (under 1MB each)

## Temporary Solution:

Until you provide actual images, the website will show broken image icons where these assets should appear. The functionality will still work, but the visual appearance will be incomplete.

## How to Add Images:

1. Save your images with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this `assets/` folder
3. Refresh the website to see the images load

The website will automatically use these images once they're in place.
